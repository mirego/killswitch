## üöß Dependencies

Every runtime dependencies are defined in the `.tool-versions` file. These external dependencies are also required:

- PostgreSQL (`~> 10.0`)

## üèé Kickstart

### Environment variables

All required environment variables are documented in [`.env.dev`](./.env.dev).

When running `rails`, `rake` or `make` commands, it is important that these variables are present in the environment. There are several ways to achieve this. Using [`nv`](https://github.com/jcouture/nv) is recommended since it works out of the box with `.env.*` files.

### Initial setup

1. Create both `.env.dev.local` and `.env.test.local` from empty values in [`.env.dev`](./.env.dev) and [`.env.test`](./.env.test)
2. Install Mix and NPM dependencies with `make dependencies`
3. Generate values for mandatory secrets in [`.env.dev`](./.env.dev) with `rake secret`

Then, with variables from `.env.dev` and `.env.dev.local` present in the environment:

4. Create and migrate the database with `rake db:setup`
5. Start the Phoenix server with `rails s`

### `make` commands

A `Makefile` is present at the root and expose common tasks. The list of these commands is available with `make help`.

### Tests

Tests can be ran with `make test`.

### Linting

Several linting and formatting tools can be ran to ensure coding style consistency:

- `make lint` ensures code follows our guidelines and best practices
- `make format` formats files using Prettier

### Continuous integration

The `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` workflow ensures that the codebase is in good shape on each pull request and branch push.

## üöë Troubleshooting

### System readiness

The project exposes a `GET /ping` route that sends an HTTP `200 OK` response as soon as the server is ready to accept requests. The response also contains the project version for debugging purpose.

### System health

The project exposes a `GET /health` route that contains checks to make sure the application and its external dependencies are healthy.

| Name       | Description                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `noop`     | This check is always healthy               |
| `database` | Check if the database connection is active |

## üöÄ Deploy

### Container

A Docker image can be created with `make build` and pushed to a registry with `make push`.
